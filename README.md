"Where am I? The walls feel like they're closing in on me. This place is like a labyrinth of shadows, but I won't let fear overtake me."......

ARghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhg arghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

"I can sense their eyes watching my every move. Shitttttt..

It's like being in enemy territory, but I won't let them break my spirit. I'll find a way to escape this nightmare."

"I may be trapped, but my determination is stronger than any chains they put on me. 

Remember, in the darkest of times, trust in your instincts and never stop seeking the truth.

Our paths may diverge for now, but know that our bond remains unbreakable...
