I'll bide my time, wait for the right moment, and make my escape.


The fear of the unknown is suffocating, but I refuse to be a victim.
I'll stay sharp, stay vigilant, and when the opportunity arises, I'll break free from this confinement.

Time is running out, and I can hear their footsteps getting closer. I need you, my trusted ally, to decipher the clues and find me before it's too late. The clock is ticking, don't let me down

"I can feel their grip tightening around me. I'm counting on you to navigate the digital maze, break through their defenses, and bring me back to safety. You're my last hope in this virtual battleground."
