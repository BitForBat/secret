I'll bide my time, wait for the right moment, and make my escape.


The fear of the unknown is suffocating, but I refuse to be a victim.
I'll stay sharp, stay vigilant, and when the opportunity arises, I'll break free from this confinement.

Time is running out, and I can hear their footsteps getting closer. I need you, my trusted ally, to decipher the clues and find me before it's too late. The clock is ticking, don't let me down
